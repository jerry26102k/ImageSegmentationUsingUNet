# ImageSegmentationUsingUNet
Segmenting images using Unet. Model is trained on kaggle dataset semantic segmentation for self driving cars.  
 
To run this project in your system in your you need to download semantic segmentation for self driving cars   
dataset from kaagle and extract it in the same directory of your py/ipynb file.  
I will recommend to train the model using GPU.
